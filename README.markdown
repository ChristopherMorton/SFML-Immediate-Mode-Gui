SFML Immediate Mode Gui
Created by: Christopher Morton

The purpose of this project is to provide a fast, flexible system for quickly deploying simple immediate-mode GUIs under SFML version 2.

While there are several gui options available, none of the others can boast the sheer simplicity and flexibility offered by my approach.  Or at least if they can, I haven't heard of them.

Currently, this IMGui includes Buttons and a Cursor Manager in addition to the underlying IMGuiManager class and several SFML utils.

This project is currently on hold.
