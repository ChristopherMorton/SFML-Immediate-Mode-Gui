SFML Immediate Mode Gui
Created by: Christopher Morton

The purpose of this project is to provide a fast, flexible system for quickly deploying simple immediate-mode GUIs under SFML version 2.*

While there are several gui options available, none of the others have the sheer simplicity and flexibility offered by an immediate-mode approach.  Or at least if they do, I haven't heard of them.

Currently, this IMGui includes Buttons and a Cursor Manager in addition to the underlying IMGuiManager class and several SFML utils.

This project is about to start moving again, maybe.
