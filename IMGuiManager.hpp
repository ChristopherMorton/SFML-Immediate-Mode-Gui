/*
 * Basically, this is a class that maintains UI state
 * and gives an immediate-mode interface to Gui widgets.
 *
 * However, this class only organizes the widgets, and so
 * they need to be constructed and loaded before they can be used.
 * This may not appear very immediate-mode, but it simply makes
 * the interface more flexible.  Rather than passing in a render
 * texture every time you need a widget, or, for instance,
 * having different rendering techniques for different classes,
 * with this, textures can be built and loaded beforehand
 * to allow for efficient and flexible rendering.
 *
 * This also makes the interface very simple.
 * Just call runWidget( "WidgetName" ) and the correct widget will
 * be drawn, interacted with, and will return the correct result.
 * Of course, each type of widget will have its own specific
 * ways to set itself up, which the user needs to do on their own.
 *
 * Also, if you like, you can access the internal widget ID of a given widget,
 * and call runWidget( id_num ).  There might be a small speedup
 * from doing this if the number of widgets is large.
 *
 * NOTE: You don't -have- to register widgets here at all.
 * The primary function of this class is to maintain the UI state.
 * If desired, you can instantiate and keep track of IMGuiWidgets
 * and manually call their doWidget() functions yourself.
 * In fact, this is recommended, as you don't need to cast from
 * IMGuiWidget* to, say, IMGuiButton* in order to do button-specific things.
 *
 * BUT: You still need to call begin() and end() regardless.
